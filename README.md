Week 3 github deliverable
data collection:
    the data was collected from potberg nature reserve
    where random memetes plants were chosen and branches were cut off
    Of the branches they had to be selected for randomly and preferable had both red and green leaves
    the leaves were then removed from the branches when testing begins so as to not lose water in the leaves

Tests
  The leaves were place on a white piece of paper to reduce absobsion of heat by the paper. With 3 leaves of green and 3 leaves of re   coloured leaves from each branch
  The the temperature of the leaves was then measured before entering a light heating room that was set to a standardised temperature of 35 degrees C for 5min. After 5min the temperatures of the leaves were measured again in the same locations as stated below.
  The leaf temperature was measured on both red and green leaves. Colours, red indicate the middle of the red leaf is where the temperature   measurement was taken. Green indicates the middle of a green leaf was recorded for temperature. Green_green indicates that the base of the   leaf or the stem of the leaf was recorded for temperature, and Red-green is the base of a red leaf.

R analysis
packages used:
tidyverse,
ggplot2,
rmarkdown,
knitr,
A boxplot was then greated using ggplot2 with the 3 variables temperaute after (temp_aft), temperature before (temp_bef) and temperature change (temp_change)
